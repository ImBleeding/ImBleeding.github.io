We also reserve the right to disclose personal information as necessary to enable third-party service providers to support and maintain the operation of our Services, or to disclose personal information to other third parties performing services in connection with the operation of our business.</p><h4>Transferring Personal Information Globally</h4><p>We operate on a global basis. Accordingly, your personal information may be transferred and stored in countries outside the Peoples Republic of China(“PRC”), the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom (“UK”), such as US, Brazil, Singapore, that are subject to different standards of data protection.

We use multiple electronic, procedural, and physical security measures to protect against unauthorized or unlawful use or alteration of information, and against any accidental loss, destruction, or damage to information.</p><p>We also have a Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) according to GDPR. The DPO is responsible for monitoring our compliance with GDPR and cooperating with supervisory authority. His contact is <a href="mailto:gamebridgenoreply@gmail.com">gamebridgenoreply@gmail.com</a>.</p><p>However, no method of transmission over the internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p><h3>5.

Send “Do Not Track” Signals</h3><p>Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites a user visits indicating user does not wish to be tracked.
